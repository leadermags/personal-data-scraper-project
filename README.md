# Personal Data Web Scraper

Goes through the copied links then extracts any emails, phone numbers, and SSN from each link that was copied then paste into an Excel workbook.

Project started off with one of Al Sweigart's *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* projects. Then I got inspired to incorporate other ways to automate and track the amount of emails and phone numbers found on websites.

There is also a .bat file template to allow you to run the script using Windows+R.

I would like to expand this project to extract other personal data.
