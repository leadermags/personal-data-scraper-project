# Phone Numbers and Email Scraper

Goes through the copied links then extracts the phone numbers and emails from each link that was copied then paste into an Excel workbook.

Project started off with one of Al Sweigart's *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* projects. Then I got inspired to incorporate other ways to automate and track the amount of emails and phone numbers on websites.

I would like to expand this project to extract other personal data.
